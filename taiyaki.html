    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A taiyaki is a fish-shaped waffle that's usually filled with sweetened red beans, though custard, cheese, and sweet potato fillings are also commonly found. 
            Cookie butter is actually a perfect filling for taiyaki — it's sweet, has a great consistency, and most importantly tastes like nostalgia, which is exactly what I want to experience when eating a taiyaki.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>5 tbsp cookie butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large measuring cup, whisk together milk, eggs, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add the wet ingredients to the bowl of dry ingredients. Mix until no streaks of flour remain.</li>
            <li>Heat up taiyaki pan over medium heat. Once both side of the pan is hot, grease the inside of the pan with vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into one side of the taiyaki pan until the 3/4 full. Add one table spoonful of cookie butter to the centre (the "belly" of the fish) and cover the filling with a bit more batter. Close the taiyaki pan and flip it, so the batter inside covers the entire pan.</li>
            <li>Cook taiyaki on each side over medium heat for about 3 minutes, until it is golden and releases from the pan easily. If taiyaki is sticking to the pan, cook the taiyaki on the same side for an addition 30 seconds – 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Remove from pan and transfer to cooling rack. Repeat will remaining batter and filling.</li>
        </ol>
