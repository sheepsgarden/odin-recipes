    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Today we are not making ice cream but we are borrowing the three-flavour concept of Neapolitan ice cream.
            Vanilla, matcha, and strawberry sugar cookie dough are gently rolled together to create a cookie of three colors and flavors.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3 tbsp freeze-dried strawberry powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp matcha powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Set the baking sheet aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together the butter and 11⁄4 cups (250 g) of the sugar on medium speed until they are smooth, about 30 seconds. Add the egg and vanilla and beat to combine.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix on low speed until just combined and no more streaks of the flour mixture remain, about 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into three equal portions. Add strawberry powder to one bowl, matcha powder to the next, while leaving one portion of dough plain.</li>
            <li>Take a tablespoon of each dough and combine the dough by rolling between the palms of your hands.</li>
            <li>Toss the dough balls in a bowl of sugar until dough ball is coated.</li>
            <li>Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between each ball. Bake the cookies for 10 to 13 minutes, until the edges of the cookies are light golden brown. Do not overbake the cookies.</li>
            <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
